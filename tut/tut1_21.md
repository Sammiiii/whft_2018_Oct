# Tutorial 1.21

You are asked to design a 3 MW, 90 m rotor diameter horizontal axis wind turbine. 
What is the minimum wind speed for the wind turbine to achieve this rated output power?

State all assumption.

## Solution (Write your solution here).
Assume air density, p=1.155kg/m³
Since P= 1/2 x p x v³ x A,
Area, A = πr² = π x 45² = 6361.725m²
3MW = 1/2 x 1.155 x v³ x 6361.725
v³ = 816.57179
v = 9.3468 m/s
